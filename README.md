# mollab
mollab is a general and universal data framework for molecular dynacmics. The core provided a language-independent data structure and it wrapper with human-friendly API to be mannipulated. It aims to compatible main stream MD code pack and reduce the most of time in modeling/analysis/format-conversion. The new version of mollab is under dev but I am too busy to do this work. If someone can offer me a doctorate, I can make some really meaningful tools rather write some meaning less paper.

TODO:
* ~~json scheme as language-independent data structure~~
* ~~API desigen~~
* ~~topo search~~
* implement with tree and graph
* `molvis` to visualize and draw molecular
* `molana` to analysis structure
* hook data in the simulation and analysis/exert
